# Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB documentation

Welcome to Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB documentation!

## Overview

Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB is a tool for replicating data from a source MongoDB cluster to a target MongoDB cluster. It supports cloning data, replicating changes, and managing collections and indexes. 

Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB requires replica set deployments of Percona Server for MongoDB and MongoDB. You must [convert your standalone instance](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/#std-label-server-replica-set-deploy-convert) to a single-node replica set to use Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB.  

Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB code is [here](https://github.com/percona/percona-clustersync-mongodb).
