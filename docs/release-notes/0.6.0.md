## Release highlights

This release provides the following improvements: 

### Replication of both unique and non-unique indexes defined on the same fields

Now PCSM not only properly reports failed or skipped index creations during the finalization stage, it also tries to automatically re-create these indexes. It re-creates a non-unique index as a unique one and then creates the original non-unique index. This way, PCSM can now replicate both unique and non-unique indexes on the same fields, which was not possible before. This makes the replication process more reliable and comprehensive.

## Namespace management for replication via CLI

You can now leverage both CLI and the API to define what namespaces to include or exclude for replication. This enables you to optimize resource utilization and manage the load on your source and target clusters by replicating only the data you care about. 

## Changelog

### Improvements

* [PCSM-131](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-131) - Add proper replication of both unique and non-unique indexes on the same fields, provide a more user-friendly report for index creation failures and try to re-create failed indexes during finalization stage.

* [PCSM-127](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-127) - Added the ability to use include and exclude filters for namespaces via the command-line interface, making it easier to manage selective replication.

* [PCSM-172](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-172) - Added retryable write operations across all PCSM components to improve reliability and prevent failures due to transient errors.

* [PCSM-173](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-173) - Improved the catalog component's lock usage to prevent long-held write locks from blocking readers.

### Fixed bugs

* [PCSM-126](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-126) - Fixed an issue where PCSM would not sync data for an entire collection if a record had a Not a Number 'NaN' ID, leading to a synchronization failure.
* [PCSM-146](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-146) - Fixed an issue where renaming a collection multiple times in a row could cause the operation to fail.
* [PCSM-147](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-147) - Fixed an issue where PCSM would fail during the data clone stage if the `_id` index was dropped.
* [PCSM-155](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-155) - Fixed an issue that prevented PCSM from proceeding with replication when the primary on the destination changed. Now it properly handles the primary change and retries the replication.
* [PCSM-178](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-178) - Fixed an issue where selective replication using `exclude` and `include` filters did not work correctly, and it would instead exclude all collections in the specified databases.
* [PCSM-184](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-184) - Fixed the issue with Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0 failing during the replication if retries of `createCollection` after `InterruptedDueToReplStateChange` return `NamespaceExists` error. It is fixed by ignoring the `NamespaceExists` error.
* [PCSM-187](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PCSM-187) - Fixed the issue with PCSM crashing during data clone by setting proper capacity for `builtIndexes` slices
